# Link Parser

A super basic utility to parse text blocks with link text and urls on a line (such as might be provided by a client to use for content production work)

## How to use

1. Visit [https://thelornenelson.github.io/link-parser/index.html](https://thelornenelson.github.io/link-parser/index.html)
2. Enter 1+ lines of text. Each line will be parsed for a URL and will generate an a tag with the remainder of the line as the link text
3. Depending on your need, either copy the links, or copy the raw HTML.
